A Donald Trump random quote generator.

The API used is the "What does Trump think" api found at - https://whatdoestrumpthink.com/api-docs/index.html

Using ES6 Javascript I have followed and modified the "Learn JavaScript by building a Random Quote Generator" tutorial created by Ayo Isaiah, the tutorial can be found here - https://freshman.tech/random-quote-machine/.

You are able to View some of Trumps most famous quotes and if you want tweet them too.

You can access Trump-Talks here - https://davidmonahan92.github.io/Trump-Talks/
